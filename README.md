This application was created as part of the cousework in for my Masters in Computer Enginerring module CS7NS4 URBAN COMPUTING in Trinity College Dublin, Assignment 4: Urban Computing application. 

I wanted to make something useful and something which might be helpful to all the urban as well as non-urban population. My application is called an “Urban Waste Identifier”, which is very simple application build for iOS operating system using Swift language with Xcode, Apple CoreML Framework & IBM’s Core ML model and Watson Visual Recognition API.

The application aims to lets its user take a picture and classify the image into any of the following categories of waste accompanied by an accuracy score of its predictions.

1. MixedRecycle-Tryandidentifyrecyclablematerialssuchametals,plastic,tetra- packs, paper, cardboard waste
2. MixedColorGlass-Tryandidentifycolorglassesandjars.
3. GeneralWaste(Landfill)-Tryandidentifygeneralwastewhichcannotbe recycles or decomposed and are mostly required to be sent into landfill, excluding non-hazardous waste material.
4. OrganicWaste(Compost)-Tryandidentifyfoodandorganicwastewhichcanbe converted into compost in some form.

My Goal of this application was to help educate more and more people including myself to distinguish between the different types of waste and contribute towards a sustainable future by reducing the recycle contamination which is huge problem for our growing Urban Population.
